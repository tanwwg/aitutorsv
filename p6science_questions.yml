  - question: |
      A cold turkey was placed in an oven which had a temperature of 160˚C. 
      After 2 hours, a thermometer was used to measure the temperature of the meat in the 
      centre of the turkey. It only read 74˚C. Why did the centre of the turkey not reach a temperature of 
      160 ˚C after 2 hours?

    answer: Turkey is not a good conductor of heat

  - question: |
      Blood flows from the heart to the head in A. Blood flows from the stomach to the heart in C. 
      Compare the blood in A and C in terms of the amount of oxygen they contain and explain your reasoning.

    answer: |
      A has more oxygen than C as the heart pumps oxygenated blood out, while the stomach uses much oxygen.

  - question: |
      John walked out of an air conditioned room and his glasses fogged up. Why?

    answer: |
      His glasses became colder from the air conditioner, and came into contact with hotter water vapour in the air. 
      This caused the water vapour to lose heat and condense on his glasses, fogging it up.

  - question: |
      The diagram shows a flower with anther. What is process K, which starts the process of forming fruit from flower?

    answer: |
      Process K is pollination, when an insect or animal brings the pollen grains of the flower from 
      the anther to the stigma of another flower.

  - question: |
      The diagram shows a flower with anther. What is process K, which starts the process of forming fruit from flower?

    answer: |
      Process L is fertilization, where the pollen grain on the stigma becomes the pollen tube and 
      allows the male reproductive cell to go down fuse with the female reproductive cell in the ovaries.
