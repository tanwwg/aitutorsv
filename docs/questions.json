        "question": "What is the time complexity of accessing an element in a linked list?\n",
        "answer": "The time complexity of accessing an element in a linked list is O(n). This is because, to access an element, you have to traverse the list from the head node, following the links until the desired element is reached."

      {
        "question": "What does FIFO stand for in data structures?\n",
        "answer": "FIFO stands for First In, First Out. It is a principle where the first element added to a data structure (like a queue) is the first one to be removed.\n"

      {
        "question": "Which data structures are commonly used to implement a stack?\n",
        "answer": "A stack is commonly implemented using an array or a linked list. Both allow push (insertion) and pop (removal) \noperations at one end, following the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.\n"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the purpose of a hash function in a hash table?\n",
        "answer": "The purpose of a hash function is to map keys to specific indices in a hash table. \nThis allows for fast retrieval of values by converting the key into an index, minimizing the time required to find the data.\n"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the main difference between a queue and a stack?\n",
        "answer": "Queue uses FIFO. Stacks use LIFO.\n"
