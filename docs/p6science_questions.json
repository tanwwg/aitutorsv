It only read 74˚C. Why did the centre of the turkey not reach a temperature of \n160 ˚C after 2 hours?\n",
      "answer": "Turkey is not a good conductor of heat",

      "question": "John walked out of an air conditioned room and his glasses fogged up. Why?\n",
      "answer": "His glasses became colder from the air conditioner, and came into contact with hotter water vapour in the air. \nThis caused the water vapour to lose heat and condense on his glasses, fogging it up.\n",
